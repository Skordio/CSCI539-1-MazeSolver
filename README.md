# RIT CSCI 539 HW 2: Maze solver

Value: 80 points
Due: Friday, 9 February 2024, 11:59 PM

1. Choose a type of state-based maze other than the 50-maze. This can come from anywhere, including the textbook, website like [logicmazes.com](logicmazes.com), ones we've used at [Imagine RIT](https://cs.rit.edu/~zjb/courses/pfc/imagine-mazes-2023.pdf) or others, or even one of your own invention. (If you choose to invent one, please include the rules with your submission!)

2. Write code to solve this maze using basic BFS, basic DFS, and at least one modified search algorithm. In comments or a separate document, explain the modification(s).

3. Provide at least two sample mazes of this type, in a format that can be directly inputted into your code (reading from a file, presumably). If it is not obvious from the format, explain how to take a maze and produce the machine-readable version.
