## Measuring Unexpected Things

One idea for measuring "unexpected things" would have to be measuring how close the path comes to the end square before it is the end. So like if you have a path where halfway through it passes by the end before returning to finally end, that would be unexpected.

## Need to implement

- ability to compare similarity of two solutions, if under a certain similarity then don't use that maze because we want one with only one solution
- ability to measure either difficulty or fun/unexpectedness
