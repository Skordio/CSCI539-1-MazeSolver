to encode the maze, we could use a file consisting just of a series of bytes, where each byte represented one square of the maze. The order of the bytes would just go from the first one in the first row, then the next one in that row, until reaching the end of the row and then the next byte would be the first cell in the next row. The first four bits would indicate which sides of the cell have walls, and the next four bits could indicate if that cell had a numerical value in it.

The maze constructor can just take that file. In the maze definition file, we could have the first byte represent the width of a row in the maze. We don't need the height, because we use the width and just read from the maze definition file, jumping down a row whenever we reach the length of a row.
